# 6502-emu
Emulator and disassembler for the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor.

Currently working on the disassembler part. Specifically trying to solve a discrepency with my codes output. If I put a binary through my disassembler, then through another written by someone else, there is a single line missing in my output. In the other disassembler, it is represented by "???" interestingly, so I'm really not sure where to start with that.
